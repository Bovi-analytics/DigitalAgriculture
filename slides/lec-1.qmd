# Course overview

## Homepage

[https://github.com/Bovi-analytics/](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/DairyHealthManagement/)[Digital Agriculture](https://bovi-analytics.github.io/DigitalAgriculture)

-   All relevant course materials (and history)
-   Links to Teams, GitHub, Dodona, etc.
-   Let's take a tour!

## Activities: Prepare, Participate, Practice, Perform {.smaller}

-   **Prepare:** Introduce new content and prepare for lectures by completing the readings
-   **Participate:** Attend and actively participate in lectures and labs, herd visits
-   **Practice:** Practice your programming skills
-   **Perform:** Put together what you've learned to analyze real-world data
    -   Dodona assignments x 5

## Grading {.smaller}

The overall team project score will be multiplied by the % of correctly submitted weekly assignments individually.

Example:

-   Your team project is graded as a group to 16/20

-   You individually submitted 80% correct assignments

-   Your end score is 0.8\*16/20 = 12.8/20

## Support

-   Office hours
-   Ask (or even better help answering) questions during the course!!!
-   Teams
-   Reserve email for questions on personal matters

## Announcements

-   During classes or email
-   If unclear, contact me

## Diversity + inclusion {.smaller}

It is my intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit.

# Course policies

## Team project

-   **Team update fridays** are supposed to be completed collaboratively.

-   Most of the times we will meet in classrooms at the **Martinus G. de Bruin** building.

-   Team updates will be at the [Future Learning Spaces](https://www.uu.nl/onderwijs/future-learning-spaces/learning-spaces/teaching-learning-lab) at the Buys Ballotgebouw; rooms 3.19 or 3.22, unless communicated otherwise.

## Academic integrity

> To uphold the [Utrecht University Code of Conduct](https://students.uu.nl/en/practical-information/policies-and-procedures/regulations):
>
> -   I will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;
>
> -   I will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors; and
>
> -   I will act if the Code is compromised.

## Farm data

-   Be aware that

    -   the participating farmers are sharing sometimes sensitive and personal data with you (part of the course).

    -   you are supposed to use that data for educational purposes only.

    -   your professional conduct is expected.

    -   you influence future participation of the collaborating farm(s).

## Most importantly!

Ask if you're not sure if something violates a policy!

# Making Digital Agriculture a success

## Five tips for success

1.  Help me understanding your needs as well.
2.  Read all the preparation material (if provided) before the lesson begins.
3.  Ask questions and actively collaborate with entire team.
4.  Perform the programming assignments.
5.  Don't let a week pass by with lingering questions.

## This week's first tasks

-   Get a Dodona account if you don't have one, you'll need it for Wednesday first lab.
-   Communicate your Gmail account with m.m.hostens\@uu.nl so I can connect you to the Digital Agriculture Google Drive and Google Colab environment.

These exercises which give you an opportunity to practice apply the statistical concepts and code introduced in the readings and lectures. These assignments are due at the end of the week by Friday 17:00.\nBecause these assignments are for practice, they will be graded based on completion, i.e., a good-faith effort has been made in attempting all parts. Successful on-time completion of at least 80% of AEs will result in full credit for AEs in the final course grade.\n\n\nCode’n practice\nIn the coding labs, you will apply the concepts discussed in lecture to various data analysis scenarios. Most lab assignments will be completed indivudually. You are expected to use the team’s GitHub repository on the course’s GitHub organization as the central platform for collaboration. Commits to this repository will be used as a metric of each team member’s relative contribution for each lab, and there will be periodic peer evaluation on the team collaboration. Lab assignments will be completed using Quarto, correspond to an appropriate GitHub repository, and submitted for grading in Gradescope.\nThe lowest lab grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nHomework\nIn homework, you will apply what you’ve learned during lecture and lab to complete data analysis tasks. You may discuss homework assignments with other students; however, homework should be completed and submitted individually. Similar to lab assignments, homework must be typed up using Quarto and GitHub and submitted as a PDF in Gradescope.\nOne homework assignment will be dedicated to a statistics experience. The statistics experience is an opportunity to engage with statistics and data science outside of the classroom through podcasts, books, seminars, data analysis competitions, and other activities. As you complete these experiences, the goal is to consider how the material you’re learning in the course connects with society more broadly.\nThe lowest homework grade will be dropped at the end of the semester.\n\n\nProject\nThe purpose of the project is to apply what you’ve learned throughout the semester to analyze an interesting, data-driven research question. The project will be completed with your lab teams, and each team will present their work in video and in writing during the final exam period. More information about the project will be provided during the semester."

Your TAs and I will help you be providing you with materials and answering questions and setting a pace, but for this to work you must do the following:\n\nComplete all the preparation work before class.\nAsk questions. As often as you can. In class, out of class. Ask me, ask the TAs, ask your friends, ask the person sitting next to you. This will help you more than anything else. If you get a question wrong on an assessment, ask us why. If you’re not sure about the homework, ask. If you hear something on the news that sounds related to what we discussed, ask. If the reading is confusing, ask.\nDo the readings.\nDo the homework and lab.The earlier you start, the better. It’s not enough to just mechanically plow through the exercises. You should ask yourself how these exercises relate to earlier material, and imagine how they might be changed (to make questions for an exam, for example.)\nDon’t procrastinate. If something is confusing to you in Week 2, Week 3 will become more confusing, Week 4 even worse, and eventually you won’t know where to begin asking questions. Don’t let the week end with unanswered questions.

    "text": "Course policies\n\nAcademic integrity\nTL;DR: Don’t cheat!\nAll students must adhere to the Duke Community Standard (DCS): Duke University is a community dedicated to scholarship, leadership, and service and to the principles of honesty, fairness, and accountability. Citizens of this community commit to reflect upon these principles in all academic and non-academic endeavors, and to protect and promote a culture of integrity.\nTo uphold the Duke Community Standard:\nStudents affirm their commitment to uphold the values of the Duke University community by signing a pledge that states:\n\nI will not lie, cheat, or steal in my academic endeavors;\nI will conduct myself honorably in all my endeavors;\nI will act if the Standard is compromised\n\nRegardless of course delivery format, it is your responsibility to understand and follow Duke policies regarding academic integrity, including doing one’s own work, following proper citation of sources, and adhering to guidance around group work projects. Ignoring these requirements is a violation of the Duke Community Standard. If you have any questions about how to follow these requirements, please contact Jeanna McCullers (jeanna.mccullers@duke.edu), Director of the Office of Student Conduct.\n\n\nCollaboration policy\nOnly work that is clearly assigned as team work should be completed collaboratively.\n\nThe homework assignments must be completed individually and you are welcomed to discuss the assignment with classmates at a high level (e.g., discuss what’s the best way for approaching a problem, what functions are useful for accomplishing a particular task, etc.). However you may not directly share answers to homework questions (including any code) with anyone other than myself and the teaching assistants.\nFor the projects, collaboration within teams is not only allowed, but expected. Communication between teams at a high level is also allowed however you may not share code or components of the project across teams.\n\n\n\nPolicy on sharing and reusing code\nI am well aware that a huge volume of code is available on the web to solve any number of problems. Unless I explicitly tell you not to use something, the course’s policy is that you may make use of any online resources (e.g. RStudio Community, StackOverflow) but you must explicitly cite where you obtained any code you directly use (or use as inspiration). Any recycled code that is discovered and is not explicitly cited will be treated as plagiarism. On individual assignments you may not directly share code with another student in this class, and on team assignments you may not directly share code with another team in this class.\n\n\nLate work policy\nThe due dates for assignments are there to help you keep up with the course material and to ensure the teaching team can provide feedback within a timely manner. We understand that things come up periodically that could make it difficult to submit an assignment by the deadline. Note that the lowest homework and lab assignment will be dropped to accommodate such circumstances.\n\nHomework and labs may be submitted up to 3 days late. There will be a 5% deduction for each 24-hour period the assignment is late.\nThere is no late work accepted for application exercises, since these are designed to help you prepare for labs and homework.\nThe late work policy for exams will be provided with the exam instructions.\nThe late work policy for the project will be provided with the project instructions.\n\n\n\nWaiver for extenuating circumstances\nIf there are circumstances that prevent you from completing a lab or homework assignment by the stated due date, you may email Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel and our head TA Rick Presman before the deadline to waive the late penalty. In your email, you only need to request the waiver; you do not need to provide explanation. This waiver may only be used for once in the semester, so only use it for a truly extenuating circumstance.\nIf there are circumstances that are having a longer-term impact on your academic performance, please let your academic dean know, as they can be a resource. Please let Dr. Çetinkaya-Rundel know if you need help contacting your academic dean.\n\n\nRegrade request policy\nRegrade requests must be submitted on Gradescope within a week of when an assignment is returned. Regrade requests will be considered if there was an error in the grade calculation or if you feel a correct answer was mistakenly marked as incorrect. Requests to dispute the number of points deducted for an incorrect response will not be considered. Note that by submitting a regrade request, the entire question will be graded which could potentially result in losing points.\nNo grades will be changed after the final project presentations.\n\n\nAttendance policy\nResponsibility for class attendance rests with individual students. Since regular and punctual class attendance is expected, students must accept the consequences of failure to attend. More details on Trinity attendance policies are available here.\nHowever, there may be many reasons why you cannot be in class on a given day, particularly with possible extra personal and academic stress and health concerns this semester. All course lectures will be recorded and available to enrolled students after class. If you miss a lecture, make sure to watch the recording and review the material before the next class session. Lab time is dedicated to working on your lab assignments and collaborating with your teammates on your project. If you miss a lab session, make sure to communicate with your team about how you can make up your contribution. Given the technologies we use in the course, this is straightforward to do asynchronously. If you know you’re going to miss a lab session and you’re feeling well enough to do so, notify your teammates ahead of time. Overall these policies are put in place to ensure communication between team members, respect for each others’ time, and also to give you a safety net in the case of illness or other reasons that keep you away from attending class.\n\n\nAttendance policy related to COVID symptoms, exposure, or infection\nStudent health, safety, and well-being are the university’s top priorities. To help ensure your well-being and the well-being of those around you, please do not come to class if you have symptoms related to COVID-19, have had a known exposure to COVID-19, or have tested positive for COVID-19. If any of these situations apply to you, you must follow university guidance related to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and current health and safety protocols. If you are experiencing any COVID-19 symptoms, contact student health at 919-681-9355. To keep the university community as safe and healthy as possible, you will be expected to follow these guidelines. Please reach out to me and your academic dean as soon as possible if you need to quarantine or isolate so that we can discuss arrangements for your continued participation in class.\n\n\nInclement weather policy\nIn the event of inclement weather or other connectivity-related events that prohibit class attendance, I will notify you how we will make up missed course content and work. This might entail holding the class on Zoom synchronously or watching a recording of the class.\n\n\nPolicy on video recording course content\nAll lectures will be recorded and available on Panopto, so students should not need to create their own recordings of lectures. If you feel that you need record the lectures yourself, you must get permission from me ahead of time and these recordings should be used for personal study only, no for distribution. The full policy on recording of lectures falls under the Duke University Policy on Intellectual Property Rights, available at provost.duke.edu/sites/default/files/FHB_App_P.pdf. Unauthorized distribution is a cause for disciplinary action by the Judicial Board."

    "section": "Exercises",
    "text": "Exercises\nDue to COVID-19 pandemic, many states made alternatives in-person voting, such as voting by mail, more widely available for the 2020 U.S. election. The general consensus was that voters who were more Democratic leaning would be more likely to vote by mail, while more Republican leaning voters would largely vote in-person. This was supported by multiple surveys, including this survey conducted by Pew Research.\nThe goal of this analysis is to use regression analysis to explore the relationship between a county’s political leanings and the proportion of votes cast in-person in 2020. The ultimate question we want to answer is “Did counties with more Republican leanings have a larger proportion of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election?”\nWe will use the proportion of votes cast for Donald Trump in 2016 (pctTrump_2016) as a measure of a county’s political leaning. Counties with a higher proportion of votes for Trump in 2016 are considered to have more Republican leanings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAll narrative should be written in complete sentences, and all visualizations should have informative titles and axis labels.\n\n\n\nPart 1: Counties in North Carolina\nFor this part of the analysis, we will focus on counties in North Carolina. We will use the data sets election_nc and county_map_data.\n\nVisualize the distribution of the response variable inperson_pct and calculate appropriate summary statistics. Use the visualization and summary statistics to describe the distribution. Include an informative title and axis labels on the plot.\nLet’s view the data in another way. Use the code below to make a map of North Carolina with the color of each county filled in based on the percentage of votes cast in-person in the 2020 election. Fill in title and axis labels.\nThen use the plot answer the following:\n\nWhat are 2 - 3 observations you have from the plot?\nWhat is a feature that is apparent in the map that wasn’t apparent from the histogram in the previous exercise? What is a feature that is apparent in the histogram that is not apparent in the map?\n\n\n\nelection_map_data &lt;- left_join(election_nc, county_map_data)\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = county_map_data,\n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group),\n    fill = \"lightgray\", color = \"white\"\n    ) +\n  geom_polygon(data = election_map_data, \n    mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group,\n    fill = inperson_pct)\n    ) +\n  labs(\n    x = \"___\",\n    y = \"___\",\n    fill = \"___\",\n    title = \"___\"\n  ) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(labels = label_percent(scale = 1)) +\n  coord_quickmap()\n\n\nCreate a visualization of the relationship between inperson_pct and pctTrump_2016. Use the visualization to describe the relationship between the two variables.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet done so, now is a good time to render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe can use a linear regression model to better quantify the relationship between the variables.\n\nFit the linear model to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nWrite the regression equation using mathematical notation.\n\nNow let’s use the model coefficients to describe the relationship.\n\nInterpret the slope. The interpretation should be written in a way that is meaningful in the context of the data.\nDoes it make sense to interpret the intercept? If so, write the interpretation in the context of the data. Otherwise, briefly explain why not.\n\nIf the linear model is a good fit to these data, there should be no structure left in the residuals and the residuals should have constant variance. Augment the data with the model to obtain the residuals and predicted values for each observation, and call the augmented data frame nc_election_aug (You will use this name in Exercise 8). Then, make a plot of the residuals vs. the fitted values, and based on this plot, and provide a brief explanation for whether these two conditions are met. Hint: Zoom out on the plot by extending the limits of the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNow is a good time to render your document again if you haven’t done so recently and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\nWe might also be interested in our observations being independent, particularly if we are to use these data for inference. To evaluate whether the independence condition is met, we will examine a map of the counties in North Carolina with the color filled based on the value of the residuals.\n\nBriefly explain why we may want to view the residuals on a map to assess independence.\nBriefly explain what pattern (if any) we would expect to observe on the map if the independence condition is satisfied.\n\nFill in the name of your model in the code below to calculate the residuals and add them to election_map_data. Then, a map with the color of each county filled in based on the value of the residual. Hint: Start with the code from Exercise 2.\nIs the independence condition satisfied? Briefly explain based on what you observe from the plot.\n\nnc_election_aug &lt;- nc_election_aug %&gt;% \n  bind_cols(fips = election_nc$fips)\n\nelection_map_data &lt;- left_join(election_map_data, nc_election_aug)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore moving on to the next part, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates.\n\n\n\n\nPart 2: Inference for the U.S.\nTo get a better understanding of the trend across the entire United States, we analyze data from a random sample of 200 counties. This data is in the election_sample data frame. Because these counties were randomly selected out of the 3,006 counties in the United States, we can reasonably treat the counties as independent observations.\n\nFit the linear model to these sample data to understand variability in the percent of in-person votes based on the percent of votes for Trump in the 2016 election. Neatly display the model output with 3 digits.\nConduct a hypothesis test for the slope using a permutation test. In your response, state the null and alternative hypotheses in words, and state the conclusion in the context of the data.\nNext, construct a 95% confidence interval for the slope using bootstrapping. Interpret the confidence interval in the context of the data.\nComment on whether the hypothesis test and confidence interval support the general consensus that Republican voters were more likely to vote in-person in the 2020 election? A brief explanation is sufficient but it should be based on your conclusions from Exercises 10 and 11.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nBefore submitting, make sure you render your document and commit (with a meaningful commit message) and push all updates."

The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate. It is not included in the 10-page limit.\nThe written report is worth 40 points, broken down as follows\n\n\n\nTotal\n40 pts\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction/data\n6 pts\n\n\nMethodology\n10 pts\n\n\nResults\n14 pts\n\n\nDiscussion + conclusion\n6 pts\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\n4 pts\n\n\n\nClick here for a PDF of the written report rubric.\n\nIntroduction and data\nThis section includes an introduction to the project motivation, data, and research question. Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO!

This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."

Under this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between \\(x\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\), such that \\(\\log(y) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x, \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). In other words, we can model the relationship between \\(x\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\) using the model in Equation 2.\n\\[\n\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\n\\tag{2}\\]\nIf we interpret the model in terms of \\(\\log(y)\\), then we can use the usual interpretations for slope and intercept. When reporting results, however, it is best to give all interpretations in terms of the original response variable \\(y\\), since interpretations using log-transformed variables are often more difficult to truly understand.\nIn order to get back on the original scale, we need to use the exponential function (also known as the anti-log), \\(\\exp\\{x\\} = e^x\\). Therefore, we use the model in Equation 2 for interpretations and predictions, we will use Equation 3 to state our conclusions in terms of \\(y\\).\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\exp\\{\\log(y)\\} = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\} \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{3}\\]\nIn order to interpret the slope and intercept, we need to first understand the relationship between the mean, median and log transformations.\n\nMean, Median, and Log Transformations\nSuppose we have a dataset y that contains the following observations:\n\n\n[1] 3 5 6 7 8\n\n\nIf we log-transform the values of y then calculate the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nmean_log_y\nmedian_log_y\n\n\n\n\n1.70503\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we calculate the mean and median of y, then log-transform the mean and median, we have\n\n\n\n\n\nlog_mean\nlog_median\n\n\n\n\n1.75786\n1.79176\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a simple illustration to show\n\n\\(\\text{Mean}[{\\log(y)}] \\neq \\log[\\text{Mean}(y)]\\) - the mean and log are not commutable\n\\(\\text{Median}[\\log(y)] = \\log[\\text{Median}(y)]\\) - the median and log are commutable\n\n\n\nInterpretaton of model coefficients\nUsing Equation 2, the mean \\(\\log(y)\\) for any given value of \\(x\\) is \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\); however, this does not indicate that the mean of \\(y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\) (see previous section). From the assumptions of linear regression, we assume that for any given value of \\(x\\), the distribution of \\(\\log(y)\\) is Normal, and therefore symmetric. Thus the median of \\(\\log(y)\\) is equal to the mean of \\(\\log(y)\\), i.e \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\).\nSince the log and the median are commutable, \\(\\text{Median}(\\log(y)) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x \\Rightarrow \\text{Median}(y) = \\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}\\). Thus, when we log-transform the response variable, the interpretation of the intercept and slope are in terms of the effect on the median of \\(y\\).\nIntercept: The intercept is expected median of \\(y\\) when the predictor variable equals 0. Therefore, when \\(x=0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x=0\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is the expected change in the median of \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) increases by 1 unit. The change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x]\\} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x+1)\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x\\}} = \\frac{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}}{\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\exp\\{\\beta_1 x\\}} = \\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x+1\\) is \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) increases by one unit, the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiply by a factor of \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_1\\}\\)."

    "text": "Log-transformation on the the response and predictor variable\nSuppose we fit a linear regression model with \\(\\log(x)\\), the log-transformed \\(x\\), as the predictor variable and \\(\\log(y)\\), the log-transformed \\(y\\), as the response variable. Under this model, we assume a linear relationship exists between \\(\\log(x)\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\), such that \\(\\log(y) \\sim N(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x), \\sigma^2)\\) for some \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\sigma^2\\). In other words, we can model the relationship between \\(\\log(x)\\) and \\(\\log(y)\\) using the model in Equation 5.\n\\[\n\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)\n\\tag{5}\\]\nBecause the response variable is log-transformed, the interpretations on the original scale will be in terms of the median of \\(y\\) (see the section on the log-transformed response variable for more detail).\nIntercept: The intercept is the mean of \\(y\\) when \\(\\log(x) = 0\\), i.e. \\(x = 1\\). Therefore, when \\(\\log(x) = 0\\),\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\log(y) = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\times 0 = \\beta_0 \\\\[10pt]\n\\Rightarrow &y = \\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nInterpretation: When \\(x = 1\\) \\((\\log(x) = 0)\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to be \\(\\exp\\{\\beta_0\\}\\).\nSlope: The slope is interpreted in terms of the change in the median \\(y\\) when \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), since \\(\\log(Cx) = \\log(x) + \\log(C)\\). Thus, when \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), the change in the median of \\(y\\) is\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\exp\\{[\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(Cx)] - [\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\log(x)]\\} &=\n\\exp\\{\\beta_1 [\\log(Cx) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1[\\log(C) + \\log(x) - \\log(x)]\\} \\\\[10pt]\n& = \\exp\\{\\beta_1 \\log(C)\\} = C^{\\beta_1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nThus, the median of \\(y\\) for \\(Cx\\) is \\(C^{\\beta_1}\\) times the median of \\(y\\) for \\(x\\).\nInterpretation: When \\(x\\) is multiplied by a factor of \\(C\\), the median of \\(y\\) is expected to multiple by a factor of \\(C^{\\beta_1}\\).

This works well when you want to learn to use R in a simple way. The downside if the local approach is that when working in a team the use of additional tools is needed (eg. GitHub).\nFollow the Dodona tutorial on the use of R and R studio (here).\n\n\nOnline\nTo access computing resources for the introductory data science courses offered by Utrecht University we will make use of the Google Colab computing services linked to the course drive storage.\nIf this is your first time accessing Google Colab, make sure you have a registered gmail address. You should have access to this ‘Shared drive’ in your Google Drive. If not, send an email to the course teacher to get access.\nMake sure you get familiar with Google Colab by reading and trying to run your first pieces of code in the ‘Welcome To Colaboratory’ notebook."

All team members should contribute to the GitHub repository, with regular meaningful commits.\nBefore you finalize your write up, make sure the printing of code chunks is off with the option echo = FALSE.\nYou will submit the PDF of your final report on Gradescope.\nThe PDF you submit must match the files in your GitHub repository exactly. The mandatory components of the report are below. You are free to add additional sections as necessary. The report, including visualizations, should be no more than 10 pages long. is no minimum page requirement; however, you should comprehensively address all of the analysis and report.\nBe selective in what you include in your final write-up. The goal is to write a cohesive narrative that demonstrates a thorough and comprehensive analysis rather than explain every step of the analysis.\nYou are welcome to include an appendix with additional work at the end of the written report document; however, grading will largely be based on the content in the main body of the report. You should assume the reader will not see the material in the appendix unless prompted to view it in the main body of the report. The appendix should be neatly formatted and easy for the reader to navigate.

Describe the data and definitions of key variables. It should also include some exploratory data analysis. All of the EDA won’t fit in the paper, so focus on the EDA for the response variable and a few other interesting variables and relationships.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe research question and motivation are clearly stated in the introduction, including citations for the data source and any external research. The data are clearly described, including a description about how the data were originally collected and a concise definition of the variables relevant to understanding the report. The data cleaning process is clearly described, including any decisions made in the process (e.g., creating new variables, removing observations, etc.) The explanatory data analysis helps the reader better understand the observations in the data along with interesting and relevant relationships between the variables. It incorporates appropriate visualizations and summary statistics.\n\n\n\nMethodology\nThis section includes a brief description of your modeling process. Explain the reasoning for the type of model you’re fitting, predictor variables considered for the model including any interactions. Additionally, show how you arrived at the final model by describing the model selection process, interactions considered, variable transformations (if needed), assessment of conditions and diagnostics, and any other relevant considerations that were part of the model fitting process.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe analysis steps are appropriate for the data and research question. The group used a thorough and careful approach to select the final model; the approach is clearly described in the report. The model selection process took into account potential interaction effects and addressed any violations in model conditions. The model conditions and diagnostics are thoroughly and accurately assessed for their model. If violations of model conditions are still present, there was a reasonable attempt to address the violations based on the course content.\n\n\n\nResults\nThis is where you will output the final model with any relevant model fit statistics.\nDescribe the key results from the model. The goal is not to interpret every single variable in the model but rather to show that you are proficient in using the model output to address the research questions, using the interpretations to support your conclusions. Focus on the variables that help you answer the research question and that provide relevant context for the reader.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe model fit is clearly assessed, and interesting findings from the model are clearly described. Interpretations of model coefficients are used to support the key findings and conclusions, rather than merely listing the interpretation of every model coefficient. If the primary modeling objective is prediction, the model’s predictive power is thoroughly assessed.\n\n\n\nDiscussion + Conclusion\nIn this section you’ll include a summary of what you have learned about your research question along with statistical arguments supporting your conclusions. In addition, discuss the limitations of your analysis and provide suggestions on ways the analysis could be improved. Any potential issues pertaining to the reliability and validity of your data and appropriateness of the statistical analysis should also be discussed here. Lastly, this section will include ideas for future work.\n\nGrading criteria\nOverall conclusions from analysis are clearly described, and the model results are put into the larger context of the subject matter and original research question. There is thoughtful consideration of potential limitations of the data and/or analysis, and ideas for future work are clearly described.\n\n\n\nOrganization + formatting\nThis is an assessment of the overall presentation and formatting of the written report.\n\nGrading criteria\nThe report neatly written and organized with clear section headers and appropriately sized figures with informative labels. Numerical results are displayed with a reasonable number of digits, and all visualizations are neatly formatted. All citations and links are properly formatted. If there is an appendix, it is reasonably organized and easy for the reader to find relevant information. All code, warnings, and messages are suppressed. The main body of the written report (not including the appendix) is no longer than 10 pages."

Use the code chunk header {r set-up, include = FALSE} to suppress this set up code.\n\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE,\n                      warning = FALSE, \n                      message = FALSE)\n\n\nHeaders\n\nUse headers to clearly label each section.\nInspect the document outline to review your headers and sub-headers.\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nInclude all references in a section called “References” at the end of the report.\nThis course does not have specific requirements for formatting citations and references.\n\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIf you have additional work that does not fit or does not belong in the body of the report, you may put it at the end of the document in section called “Appendix”.\nThe items in the appendix should be properly labeled.\nThe appendix should only be for additional material. The reader should be able to fully understand your report without viewing content in the appendix.\n\n\n\nResize figures\nResize plots and figures, so you have more space for the narrative.\n\n\nArranging plots\nArrange plots in a grid, instead of one after the other. This is especially useful when displaying plots for exploratory data analysis and to check assumptions.\nIf you’re using ggplot2 functions, the patchwork package makes it easy to arrange plots in a grid. See the documentation and examples here.\n\n\nPlot titles and axis labels\nBe sure all plot titles and axis labels are visible and easy to read.\n\nUse informative titles, not variable names, for titles and axis labels.\n\n❌ NO! The x-axis is hard to read because the names overlap.\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n✅ YES! Names are readable\n\nggplot(data = mpg, aes(y = manufacturer)) +\n  geom_bar()\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDo a little more to make the plot look professional!\n\nInformative title and axis labels\nFlipped coordinates to make names readable\nArranged bars based on count\nCapitalized manufacturer names\nOptional: Added color - Use a coordinated color scheme throughout paper / presentation\nOptional: Applied a theme - Use same theme throughout paper / presentation\n\n\nmpg %&gt;%\n  count(manufacturer) %&gt;%\n  mutate(manufacturer = str_to_title(manufacturer)) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(manufacturer,n), x = n)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", fill = \"steelblue\") +\n  labs(x = \"Manufacturer\", \n       y = \"Count\", \n       title = \"The most common manufacturer is Dodge\") +\n  theme_minimal() \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables and model output\n\nUse the kable function from the knitr package to neatly output all tables and model output. This will also ensure all model coefficients are displayed.\n\nUse the digits argument to display only 3 or 4 significant digits.\nUse the caption argument to add captions to your table.\n\n\n\nmodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)\ntidy(model) %&gt;%\n  kable(digits = 3)\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n30.099\n1.634\n18.421\n0\n\n\nhp\n-0.068\n0.010\n-6.742\n0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGuidelines for communicating results\n\nDon’t use variable names in your narrative! Use descriptive terms, so the reader understands your narrative without relying on the data dictionary.\n\n❌ There is a negative linear relationship between mpg and hp.\n✅ There is a negative linear relationship between a car’s fuel economy (in miles per gallon) and its horsepower.\n\nKnow your audience: Your report should be written for a general audience who has an understanding of statistics at the level of STA 210.\nAvoid subject matter jargon: Don’t assume the audience knows all of the specific terminology related to your subject area. If you must use jargon, include a brief definition the first time you introduce a term.\nTell the “so what”: Your report and presentation should be more than a list of interpretations and technical definitions. Focus on what the results mean, i.e. what you want the audience to know about your topic after reading your report or viewing your presentation.\n\n❌ For every one unit increase in horsepower, we expect the miles per gallon to decrease by 0.068 units, on average.\n✅ If the priority is to have good fuel economy, then one should choose a car with lower horsepower. Based on our model, the fuel economy is expected to decrease, on average, by 0.68 miles per gallon for every 10 additional horsepower.\n\nTell a story: All visualizations, tables, model output, and narrative should tell a cohesive story!\nUse one voice: Though multiple people are writing the report, it should read as if it’s from a single author. At least one team member should read through the report before submission to ensure it reads like a cohesive document."
